## Introduction

Weebo is a project I started in the summer of 2017. I was inspired by the movie Flubber which features Robin William's self-built personal assistant robot Weebo. I 3D printed the model taken from Edward Zarick (http://www.edsjunk.net/wordpress/weebo/). This repo contains the program that runs on a Raspberry Pi fitted inside the robot.
